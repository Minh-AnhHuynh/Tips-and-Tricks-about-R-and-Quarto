End with a citation. [@citation]](figures/figure.png){#fig:label short-caption=\"**Short bold caption**.\"}\nCross-reference in-line with this syntax : @fig-label\n\n\n2.1.2 captioner package\nBased on this thread, or this one from stackoverflow, you can run this LaTeX code to do so :\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics{figure.jpg} \n\\caption[\\textbf{Bold caption.}]\n{\\textbf{Figure or table description. (\\cite{Meza-Meza.2020}) or Adapted from \\textcite{Author}}\n\\label{fig-label}\n\\end{figure}\nNote that I return to a new line to make it easier to read.\nWrite \\listoffigures to generate the list of figures.\nThen you can crossreference the figure using a LaTeX command : **(Figure \\ref{label})**\nI originally used this method because I didn’t know about the pandoc filters. I’d have to say the pandoc way is easier to write, and you can have a miniature image in source or visual mode inside R Studio.\nOne minor hiccup of the latex way is that if you ever switch to the source pane, any bolded crossreference with latex syntax will be undone. Such as : From **(Figure \\ref{fig:vitd3})** to **(Figure** \\ref{fig:vitd3}) when going to source and back. This is quite annoying. So I’d rather use pandoc from now.\nUpdate : The cleveref package Section 3.1 solves this problem.\n\n\n2.1.3 Built-in Quarto attribute using fig-scap\nUnknowingly, the figure attribute fig-scap solves the problem.\n![Long caption](R_logo.png){#fig-label fig-scap=\"A short caption\"}\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Long caption"

When you use aes(color = “line”), you are mapping the color aesthetic to a constant string “line”, which means that all the points or lines will have the same color, and that color will be determined by the color scale associated with the “line” category. However, when you include colour = “blue” within the geom_function, you are effectively overriding the color aesthetic that you set with aes(color = “line”). This means that all elements drawn by this specific geom_function will be colored in blue, and ggplot2 will not create a legend because there’s no mapping of aesthetics that varies. If you want to specify a different color for this specific geom_function and still have a legend, you can do the following:\n\n\nbase_plot + \n  geom_function(\n    fun = dnorm,\n    aes(color = \"line\"),\n    show.legend = TRUE\n  ) +\n  scale_colour_manual(\n    name = \"Legend\",\n    values = c(\"line\" = \"red\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\nMore information : Indirectly referring to a variable"
