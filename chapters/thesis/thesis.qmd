# Tips and Trick to write your Thesis in Quarto

Below are some tips and tricks that I needed to use alongside the
regular Quarto settings, which were unfortunately not enough to fully
format my thesis just like how I wanted. I had to scour the internet and
stackoverflow alongside some latex documentation, and I hope this will
help someone one day. Or else it serves as a nice little documentation
for future usage.

## Add short captions to List of Tables with pandoc filters and LaTeX

AKA how to add only part of figure caption in list of figures
### Pandoc filter : short-captions

Based on this
[discussion](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/3769)
which leads to the usage of the
[short-captions](https://github.com/pandoc/lua-filters/tree/master/short-captions)
pandoc filter.

First add the filter to the yaml header:

``` yaml
filters:
  - "pandoc-filters/short-captions.lua"
```

``` markdown
![**Bold caption.** Additional caption. End with a citation. [@citation]](figures/figure.png){#fig:label short-caption="**Short bold caption**."}
```
[Cross-reference](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html) in-line with this syntax : `@fig-label`


### captioner package

Based on [this thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69094228/give-a-single-figure-multiple-captions-in-rmarkdown-pdf-book-output),
or [this one](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/83392/change-caption-in-list-of-tables) from stackoverflow, you can run this LaTeX code to do so :

``` tex
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{figure.jpg} 
\caption[\textbf{Bold caption.}]
{\textbf{Figure or table description. (\cite{Meza-Meza.2020}) or Adapted from \textcite{Author}}
\label{fig-label}
\end{figure}
```

Note that I return to a new line to make it easier to read.

Write `\listoffigures` to generate the list of figures.

Then you can crossreference the figure using a LaTeX command :
`**(Figure \ref{label})**`

I originally used this method because I didn't know about the pandoc
filters. I'd have to say the pandoc way is easier to write, and you can
have a miniature image in source or visual mode inside R Studio.

One minor hiccup of the latex way is that if you ever switch to the
source pane, any bolded crossreference with latex syntax will be undone.
Such as : From `**(Figure \ref{fig:vitd3})**` to
`**(Figure** \ref{fig:vitd3})` when going to source and back. This is
quite annoying. So I'd rather use pandoc from now.

Update : The cleveref package @sec-bold-crossref solves this problem.

### Built-in Quarto attribute using fig-scap

Unknowingly, the figure attribute [fig-scap](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/cells/cells-knitr.html#figures) solves the problem.

``` markdown
![Long caption](R_logo.png){#fig-label fig-scap="A short caption"}
```
![Long caption](R_logo.png){#fig-label fig-scap="A short caption"}

\listoffigures

## Automatically bold cross-reference (Figure, Table #) {#sec-bold-crossref}

Instead of using `(**Figure \ref{figure:stuff}**)`, use `\cref{figure:stuff}` which will automatically put "Figure" or "Table" or something else as appropriate.

To add automatic bold, add to the preambule :

``` yaml
header-includes:
- \usepackage[capitalise,noabbrev, nameinlink]{cleveref} # Allows \cref{} to cite latex table as "Table 3"
# Specify which cross-reference should automatically be bolded : Tables and Figures
# Use \cref{} ; For some reason this only works with this exact disposition :
# Only #1, nameinlink and each of the reference specified. namelink + #1#2#3 would give an error.
- \crefdefaultlabelformat{#2\textbf{#1}#3} # <-- Only #1 in \textbf
- \crefname{table}{\textbf{Table}}{\textbf{Tables}}
- \Crefname{table}{\textbf{Table}}{\textbf{Tables}}
- \crefname{figure}{\textbf{Figure}}{\textbf{Figures}} 
- \Crefname{figure}{\textbf{Figure}}{\textbf{Figures}}
```
The parameter `nameinlink` could be removed, but it allows the link to span both the number and the cross-referenced material (Table + #) and not just the number, which I find more practical.

## Add your table of content to the pdf bookmark

The generated pdf document has a convenient bookmark function for ease
of navigation. The bookmark automatically includes pandoc headers,
except your table of content.\
Add the bookmark package to include headers, and then use the following
command:

``` yaml
header-includes:
- \usepackage{setspace} # Example of another package used. This syntax will not work with only one package.
- \usepackage{bookmark}
```

``` tex
% Add the command just before the toc.
\pdfbookmark[section]{\contentsname}{toc}
% Next command is to rename the table of content
\renewcommand{\contentsname}{Table des matiÃ¨res}
\tableofcontents{}
\newpage
```

## Remove a section from your table of contents in pandoc

[You need to combine .unlisted with .unnumbered to achieve
this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49573734/do-not-include-section-in-toc-in-pandoc),
as stated in [Pandoc
documentation](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#heading-identifiers).

(I have looked inside the Pandoc documentation however and I have no
idea where that is stated).

Also, I discovered it was literally marked in the [Quarto
documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/pdf-basics.html#table-of-contents)
itself !

``` tex
# Abstract {.unnumbered .unlisted}

# Acknowledgements {.unnumbered .unlisted}

# Chapter 1
```

## Continuous figure numbering

If you want something like Figure 1, Figure 2 instead of Figure 1.1,
Figure 1.2, you need to use the following latex command :

``` tex
- \counterwithout{figure}{chapter} 
- \counterwithout{figure}{section}
```

This is working for me, using scrreport as the document class (KOMA
class).

### **Explanation** :

[Changing the numbering of (e.g.) figures involves two
modifications](https://imathworks.com/tex/tex-latex-continuous-v-per-chapter-section-numbering-of-figures-tables-and-other-document-elements/):

-   Redefining whether or not the figure counter will be reset whenever
    the chapter/section counter is incremented;

-   Redefining the "appearance" of the figure counter (\thefigure),
    i.e., removing (or adding) the chapter/section prefix.

[**`\counterwithout{somecounter}{anothercounter}`**](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Counters#.5Ccounterwithout.7Bsomecounter.7D.7Banothercounter.7D)

`\counterwithout{somecounter}{anothercounter}` removes the link between
*`somecounter`* and *`anothercounter`* so that they are independent. For
any pair of counters, you can switch between using `\counterwithout` and
`\counterwithin`, as the following example shows for the `example` and
`section` counters---you can open this example in Overleaf using the
link provided below the code.


# Fix bugs

## Delete the biber cache

If for some unknown reason, you're trying to generate your bibliography and Quarto hits you with

```
generating bibliography
  Couldn't load any math lib(s), not even fallback to Calc.pm at C:\Users\Minh-Anh\AppData\Local\Temp\par-4d696e682d416e68\cache-5e43119d746c745befc6eda076997d4ff7d8b07a\19c9b262.pm line 25.
etc.
```
Go to the specified file path and delete the folders. What a headache.

Also, `biber --cache` shows you where it is (and if it's bugged, you'll be greeted with this awesome bug error).

# Bibliography

## Include an organization name in citeproc

Just include double brackets around your {{organization}} and citeproc
will format correctly.

``` tex
@article{IOM.2011.org,
year = {2011},
title = {{Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium and Vitamin D}},
author = {{Institute of Medicine}},
journal = {The National Academies Press},
doi = {10.17226/13050},
pages = {1115},
keywords = {},
}
```
